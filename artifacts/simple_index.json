For example, the East Edge bus is extremely popular with students. It is popular because students know where it will take them, when it will arrive, and when it will get them to their destination. These factors allow students to plan public transportation into their routine. The on-campus routes, on the other hand, have no set schedule, so it is impossible to actually plan to use them unless you have an extra 3 hours in your day to wait around for one and wonder when it will get to you.",
