        "Improve the Campus Ride - I would use it consistently around campus if it had consistent, predictable arrival and departure times. For example, the East Edge bus is extremely popular with students. It is popular because students know where it will take them, when it will arrive, and when it will get them to their destination. These factors allow students to plan public transportation into their routine. The on-campus routes, on the other hand, have no set schedule, so it is impossible to actually plan to use them unless you have an extra 3 hours in your day to wait around for one and wonder when it will get to you.",
        "Lowering cost. It is ridiculous as a student to pay $400 extra for a spot when we already pay tuition plus a multitude of other fees. ",

        "We need to adapt to common transit features like other campuses around the US. Passio go is too confusing to the average student. If students could track the busses and learn how to get somewhere just using maps, I\u2019m confident that Crimson Ride usage would greatly increase. "
